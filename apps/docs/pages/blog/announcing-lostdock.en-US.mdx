# Announcing Lostdock

Today we are excited to announce the release of Lostdock, a new open source project
that makes it easy to deploy your apps to your old school VPS.

## An affordable way to deploy your apps

VPS hosting is a great way to deploy your apps. It's cheap, reliable, and
flexible. But it's also a pain to set up. You have to install and configure
everything yourself, and you have to do it on every new server you spin up.

## Lostdock makes it easy

Lostdock is a tool that makes it easy to deploy your apps to your VPS. It
automates the process of installing and configuring everything you need to run
Docker Compose stacks on your VPS.

Then it makes it easy to deploy your apps to your VPS by providing a simple
command line interface to run Docker Compose stacks.

## Early development

We are still in the early stages of development. However, we are already using
the tool in production to deploy our own apps, and even [these docs](https://github.com/carlosbaraza/lostdock/tree/main/apps/docs/deployments/production) ([CI/CD deployment workflow](https://github.com/carlosbaraza/lostdock/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml#L87-L97)).

## Getting started
