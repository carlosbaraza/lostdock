# Getting Started

The main goal of Lostdock is to make it easy to deploy and manage Docker Compose stacks on your server. VPS servers
are ubiquitous and cheap. They are a great way to host your own services. The biggest problem is
orchestration of services. Lostdock solves this problem by providing a simple CLI to deploy and manage Docker Compose stacks.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g lostdock
```

## Init a server

Create a new Debian/Ubuntu VPS in your preferred cloud provider. Then init the server:

```bash
# After creating a new VPS, login via SSH
lostdock login

# Install Docker Compose and start the firewall.
lostdock server init
```

## Deploying

Once you have a server running, you can run a pre-configured stack from GitHub. For example, let's run our [lostdock-traefik](/docs/core-stacks/lostdock-traefik) reverse proxy stack with auto generated TLS certificates

```bash
export TRAEFIK_HOST=traefik.example.com
export TRAEFIK_BASIC_AUTH="$(echo $(htpasswd -nb admin admin) | sed -e s/\\$/\\$\\$/g)"
export LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=example@example.com

# Start Traefik reverse proxy
lostdock stacks install-from-git \
    --url https://github.com/carlosbaraza/lostdock.git \
    --path ./packages/lostdock-traefik
```

We also recommend running the following stacks: [lostdock-monitoring](/docs/core-stacks/lostdock-monitoring) (log and metric aggregation and visualization stack) and [lostdock-portainer](/docs/core-stacks/lostdock-portainer) (container management).

    You can also deploy your own stack. Create a new stack with `lostdock stacks create` and then edit the `.env` file to configure the hostname.

```
lostdock stacks create --name example
cd example
```

Edit `.env` hostname:

```yaml filename=".env"
# This file is used to store environment variables for the stack.
# It is not checked into source control.
# You can use the environment variables in your docker-compose.yml file.

# The domain name for the stack. Used in the docker-compose.yml service traefik configuration.
HOST="example.lostdock.com"
```

Review the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml filename="docker-compose.yml"
version: "3.9"

networks:
  # Network where traefik reverse proxy is running
  proxy:
    external: true

services:
  # Simple web service. It uses lostdock-traefik for the dynamic reverse proxy with automated TLS          certificates.
  whoami:
    image: "nginx"
    volumes:
      - ./src:/usr/share/nginx/html

    # Expose the environment variables to your service
    env_file:
      - ./.env

    # Always restart the container if it fails
    restart: always
    # We can change the amount of containers running at the same time
    deploy:
      mode: replicated
      replicas: 1
      endpoint_mode: vip

    # We need to add the service to the traefik network
    networks:
      - proxy

    # Traefik configuration is fetched dynamically from the labels of other running containers
    labels:
      - traefik.enable=true
      # Don't forget to add an A record pointing to the server IP address to your DNS.
      - traefik.http.routers.example.rule=Host(`${HOST}`)
      - traefik.http.routers.example.service=example
      - traefik.http.routers.example.entrypoints=websecure
      - traefik.http.routers.example.tls=true
      - traefik.http.routers.example.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt
      - traefik.http.services.example.loadbalancer.server.port=80
```

Finally, install the stack:

```bash
lostdock stacks install
```

      It will perform the following actions:

      - Run `./install-local.sh` (validate configuration)
      - Push stack configuration files to server
      - Run `./install-server.sh` (preparation before starting stack. E.g. change permissions, create volumes, networks, etc)
      - Run `docker compose up`.
