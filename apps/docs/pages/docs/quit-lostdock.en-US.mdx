# Quit lostdock. Core Internals

Lostdock is a relatively simple piece of software that uses bare and ubiquitous standard tools (e.g. `bash` scripts).
We aim to keep it like that, so it can be easily replaced by other tools or even by simple bash scripts.

We provide a bunch of useful tools to manage Docker Compose stacks in your server. However, if you are not
happy with the project, you can easily replace it with your own tools running bare `docker compose` commands.
