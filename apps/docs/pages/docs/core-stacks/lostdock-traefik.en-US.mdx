# lostdock-traefik

We preconfigured a Traefik reverse proxy with auto generated TLS certificates. It also includes a basic auth middleware.

<Callout>
    This stack is highly recommended, as you need a reverse proxy to use the other stacks exposing an HTTP service. In the future
    we might support other reverse proxies, but at the moment, we thought
    that Traefik was a great piece of Software that suited most needs.

## Usage

```bash
export TRAEFIK_HOST=traefik.example.com
export TRAEFIK_BASIC_AUTH="$(echo $(htpasswd -nb admin admin) | sed -e s/\\$/\\$\\$/g)"

# Start Traefik reverse proxy
