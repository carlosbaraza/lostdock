# lostdock-monitoring

We preconfigured a stack to ease monitoring and log aggregation. Multiple metrics are automatically collected from your
server and every docker container. All the logs produced by each container are aggregated using Promtail and Loki in the
same Grafana environment.

<Callout>
    We highly encourage you to install this stack. It will help you to monitor your running stacks, produce alerts, and explore the logs.
    We completely replaced our use of Datadog with this stack. It's a great alternative to Datadog, and it's free.

## Usage

```bash
export GRAFANA_HOST=grafana.example.com
export NETDATA_HOST=netdata.example.com
export NETDATA_BASIC_AUTH="$(echo $(htpasswd -nb admin admin) | sed -e s/\\$/\\$\\$/g)"
export PROMETHEUS_HOST=prometheus.example.com
export PROMETHEUS_BASIC_AUTH="$(echo $(htpasswd -nb admin admin) | sed -e s/\\$/\\$\\$/g)"
export ALERTMANAGER_HOST=alertmanager.example.com
export ALERTMANAGER_BASIC_AUTH="$(echo $(htpasswd -nb admin admin) | sed -e s/\\$/\\$\\$/g)"

## Features

- The tools that are included are:
  - `Grafana`: visualize and explore metrics and logs
  - `Prometheus`: collect metrics from your server and containers, shipped automatically to Grafana
  - `Loki`, `Promtail`: automatic log aggregation from your server
  - `Netdata`: extremely useful UI to manage the server
  - `Alertmanager`: manage alerts produced from your metrics
  - `cAdvisor`: get metrics from your running containers
  - `Node Exporter`: get metrics from your server
- All the tools are shipped in a single `docker-compose.yml` file
- Data is stored in subfolders of the stack. You can easily backup and restore the data.
- We include some preconfigured Grafana dashboards and alerts

## Configuration

In order to configure the different components, you can SSH into your server and edit all the configuration files and the `docker-compose.yml` under `~/stacks/lostdock-monitoring`. Once you are done, restart the stack running `docker compose -d --force-recreate` from the stack root folder in the server.

Alternatively, you can create a new folder in your local machine and run `lostdock stacks pull --stack lostdock-monitoring` to download the stack files. Then, you can edit the files and run `lostdock stacks pull --stack lostdock-monitoring` to download the stack configuration from the server. You can edit locally and then push the changes with `lostdock stacks push` and run the stack with `lostdock stacks up`.
