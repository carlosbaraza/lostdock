# lostdock-monitoring

We preconfigured a stack to ease monitoring and log aggregation. Multiple metrics are automatically collected from your
server and every docker container. All the logs produced by each container are aggregated using Promtail and Loki in the
same Grafana environment.

<Callout>
    We highly encourage you to install this stack. It will help you to monitor your running stacks, produce alerts, and explore the logs.
    We completely replaced our use of Datadog with this stack. It's a great alternative to Datadog, and it's free.

## Usage

```bash
export GRAFANA_HOST=grafana.example.com
export NETDATA_HOST=netdata.example.com
