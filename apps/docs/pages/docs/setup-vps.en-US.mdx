# Setup new VPS

## First, create a new VPS

We recommend starting from scratch with a new VPS from your favourite cloud provider. If you already have a VPS, you can skip this step.

<Callout>
    We built the init script with **Ubuntu/Debian** in mind, so it might not work on other distributions. If you're using a different distribution, you can still use the init script as a reference or contribute to the project to support your distribution.

## Login to the server with SSH

When you created the server, ensure that you have a SSH key pair configured to login to the server. The SSH key is usually located in `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` on your local machine.

Login to the server:

```bash
# Login to the server. It will prompt you for the host.
lostdock login
```

```markdown
  Usage
    $ lostdock login

  Login to your server. Store the login config in ~/.lostdock/logins.json

  Commands:
    set-default ········ Set default login from your logins: ~/.lostdock/logins.json

  Options:
    --host ············· Your server's hostname (e.g. server.example.com). An IP address is also acceptable.
    --user ············· Your SSH username (e.g. root).
    --privateKeyPath ··· Your SSH private key (e.g. ~/.ssh/id_rsa).
    --whoami, -w ······· Show current login configuration
    --list, -l ········· Show all saved login configurations
    --help, -h ········· Show help
```

## Init the server

The init script will install some dependencies, update your packages, install Docker, Docker Compose and configure the firewall.

```bash
lostdock server init
```

## Deploy your first stack

Now that you have a working server, you can [deploy a pre-configured stack](/docs/deploy-pre-configured-stacks) or [your own stack](/docs/deploy-your-stacks).
