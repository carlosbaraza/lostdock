# Deploy your stacks

You can also deploy your own stack. Create a new stack with `lostdock stacks create` and then edit the `.env` file to configure the hostname.

```
lostdock stacks create --name example
cd example
```

The example folder contains a basic example of an Nginx web server to get started. You can add more services to the stack using your own images later.

## .env file

The `.env` file is a convention to store environment variables. Docker Compose automatically reads this file and allows you to interpolate
the values directly in the `docker-compose.yml` file, which is a powerful feature.

Now, let's edit the hostname for the service to something that you control. Don't forget to point DNS A records
to the public IP address of your server.

```yaml filename=".env"
# This file is used to store environment variables for the stack.
# It is not checked into source control.
# You can use the environment variables in your docker-compose.yml file.

# The domain name for the stack. Used in the docker-compose.yml service traefik configuration.
HOST="example.lostdock.com"
```

## docker-compose.yml file

Review the `docker-compose.yml` file. It contains the configuration for the stack. You can add more services to the stack.

```yaml filename="docker-compose.yml"
version: "3.9"

networks:
  # Network where traefik reverse proxy is running
  proxy:
    external: true

services:
  # Simple web service. It uses lostdock-traefik for the dynamic reverse proxy with automated TLS          certificates.
  whoami:
    image: "nginx"
    volumes:
      - ./src:/usr/share/nginx/html

    # Expose the environment variables to your service
    env_file:
      - ./.env

    # Always restart the container if it fails
    restart: always
    # We can change the amount of containers running at the same time
    deploy:
      mode: replicated
      replicas: 1
      endpoint_mode: vip

    # We need to add the service to the traefik network
    networks:
      - proxy

    # Traefik configuration is fetched dynamically from the labels of other running containers
    labels:
      - traefik.enable=true
      # Don't forget to add an A record pointing to the server IP address to your DNS.
      - traefik.http.routers.example.rule=Host(`${HOST}`)
      - traefik.http.routers.example.service=example
      - traefik.http.routers.example.entrypoints=websecure
      - traefik.http.routers.example.tls=true
      - traefik.http.routers.example.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt
      - traefik.http.services.example.loadbalancer.server.port=80
```

### Install the stack:

```bash
lostdock stacks install
```

      It will perform the following actions:

      - Run `./install-local.sh` (validate configuration)
      - Push stack configuration files to server
      - Run `./install-server.sh` (preparation before starting stack. E.g. change permissions, create volumes, networks, etc)
      - Run `docker compose up`.

## Deploying your own images

You can sign up to DockerHub and push your own images to the registry. You can also use a private registry (paid feature). We might consider adding a free private registry in the future.

Your images could be built on your CI/CD (e.g. GitHub Actions) and pushed to the registry. You can also build the images on the server using `docker build` and `docker push`.

## Updating your stack

Store a `IMAGE_TAG` environment variable in the `.env` file.

The `docker-compose.yml` service image can contain an environment variable to be used as a template. The image tag will be replaced with the value of the environment variable.

```yaml filename="docker-compose.yml"
...
services:
  example:
    image: "myorg/example:${IMAGE_TAG}"
...
```

You can update the stack by running:

```bash
lostdock stacks env set --stack example --key IMAGE_TAG --value 1.0.0
lostdock stacks up --stack example
```

## CI/CD example

Checkout the [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/carlosbaraza/lostdock/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml#L87-L97) we use to deploy these docs:

In a gist, the workflow is setting up the SSH key, building the Docker image, and pushing it to DockerHub registry. Then we
run the following commands to deploy the latest version of the stack.

```bash
cd ./apps/docs/deployments/production
npm i -g lostdock
lostdock login --host lostdock.com --privateKeyPath ~/.ssh/id_rsa
lostdock stacks env pull --silent
lostdock stacks env set --local --key HOSTNAME --value lostdock.com
lostdock stacks env set --local --key VERSION --value ${{ env.VERSION }}
lostdock stacks env set --local --key ENV --value production
lostdock stacks push
lostdock stacks up
```

However, you can use any CI/CD tool you want, or any set of commands to deploy your stack.
